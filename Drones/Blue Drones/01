A security group was configured with a rule to allow HTTPS traffic to an instance. What will happen if an HTTP connection is attempetd? 

1) The security group will allow the incoming connection but will deny the outgoing connection

2) Unless there is a rule explicitly allowing HTTP, the security group will deny the connection (correct) 

3) The security group will allow the connection because HTTPS implies HTTP as well
